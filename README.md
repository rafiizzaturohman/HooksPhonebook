# Phonebook

<h2>Introduction</h2>

This is a simple full-stack React application that allows you to store the names and phone numbers of your friends, family or other people you know.

An application based on [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), [PostgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/), [ReactJS](https://react.dev/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en).

Client side code is written in React and the server API is written in ExpressJS.

<h2>Before You Begin</h2>

Before you begin I recommend you to read about the basic building blocks that assamble this application:
* PostgresQL - Go through [PostgresQL Official Website](https://www.postgresql.org/) and proceed to their [Official Manuat or Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/), which should help you understand SQL and PostgresQL better.
* ExpressJS - The best way to understand ExpressJS is through it's (Official Manuar or Documentation)[https://expressjs.com/], which has a (Getting Started)[https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html] guide, as well an (ExpressJS)[https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html] guide for general express topics.
* ReactJS - React's (Official Website)[https://react.dev/] is a great starting point.
